# bike_mock_android
This project imitated a bikeseoul.

I used a kakao map API and public data.

When requesting data, retrofit was used.

For your information, public data can be used for a month.

In fact, the data I used is information about public bicycle rental shops and foreign rental shops.

It does not use LCD and QR rental information.
